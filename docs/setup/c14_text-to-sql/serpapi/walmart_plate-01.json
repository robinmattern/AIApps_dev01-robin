          "text": "This is a really nice little plate for many uses. It is great for snacks when watching your favorite show on tv. These aren't just for kids us seniors could make good use of them too. I like using it for portion control. These are really sturdy well-made plates that will hold up to all that rough housing kids can dish out. The design makes it easy for little ones to carry it around. Also, some seniors have a difficult time holding onto things, so this design will be very appreciated by those people.\nOne of my favorite things about this plate is its microwave and dishwasher safe. It also comes in other colors that happens to be just as pretty. Want something for the little ones check out the kids 24-piece dinnerware set at an unbelievable price, and that's not all you can get matching bowls or a 4 pack of 15oz. tumblers in assorted colors.  You can get any or all of these at an awesome price at Walmart. \nDon't forget we have Christmas coming up its time to start thinking about shopping and these would make a really nice gift.",

          "text": "This BPA-free plastic, dark pink plate is 7.5” in diameter, a little over 1” high and is microwave-safe. We did not have it in the microwave for more than 1-2 minutes but it held its form. It can be placed in a dishwasher on the top rack only. It will warp over time if placed on the bottom rack. We prefer not to use this type of plate at home for a family dinner meal but it is an ideal plate for a child, an on-the-go student or even camping!  It is not thin and does not bend when loaded up with food like wasteful paper plates. It withstands cutting meat or fruit without leaving plastic shavings behind.  Food rinses off of it easily and can be hand washed quickly to air dry in a sink strainer or dish rack. It stacks neatly with others of the same size and takes up minimal cupboard space.",
